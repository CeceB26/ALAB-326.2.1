# QR Code Component

This project is a solution to the **QR Code Component** challenge from Frontend Mentor.
It focuses on building a clean, responsive layout using **HTML and CSS**, with attention to alignment, spacing, and visual hierarchy.

---

## 📸 Preview

The component displays:

* A light gray page background
* A light blue container panel with subtle shadow
* A centered white card containing:

  * A QR code image
  * Heading text
  * Supporting description

The layout is responsive and adapts well to desktop and mobile screen sizes.

---

## 🛠️ Built With

* **HTML5**
* **CSS3**

  * Flexbox for layout
  * Responsive units (`vw`, `%`)
* **VS Code**
* **Live Server** (for local development)

No frameworks or libraries were used.

---

## 🎯 What I Learned

* How to properly center elements using Flexbox
* The importance of letting containers wrap content instead of forcing height
* How padding and max-width affect layout balance
* How to test responsiveness using browser DevTools and real devices
* Avoiding dependency on framework classes without importing the framework

---

## 📱 Responsive Testing

The layout was tested using:

* Browser resizing
* Chrome DevTools device emulator
* Mobile screen sizes (phone viewport)

The card remains centered and readable across screen sizes.

1. Clone or download the repository
2. Open the folder in **VS Code**
